How to use:

Download and run the program, follow displayed instructions. First type 0 or 1 to choose rendering mode, then noise strength (value from 2 to 510). Processing may take long, but if the program freezes, click inside its window and click ENTER/RETURN multiple times. If the program closes or crashes then you either typed an invalid value in one of the inputs or the chosen image file's internal structure is not supported. You can make images compatible by for example opening them in MS Paint and then saving them as PNG or JPG.
